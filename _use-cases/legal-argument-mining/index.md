Identifying, classifying, and analyzing arguments in legal discourse has been a prominent area of research since the inception of the argument mining field.

We designed a new annotation scheme for legal arguments in proceedings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and used the INCEpTION tool to annotate a large corpus of 373 court decisions (2.3M tokens and 15k annotated argument spans).

In doing so, we made use of the following features of the INCEpTION platform:

* Annotation of spans involving multiple annotation layers
* Importing and exporting UIMA CAS annotations with [dkpro-cassis](https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-cassis)
* Utilities for monitoring annotator progress and computing inter-annotator agreement
* Semi-automatic and manual curation of the final dataset
